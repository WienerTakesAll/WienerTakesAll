To build PhysX and APEX SDKs: 

(1) Build PhysX SDK by opening one of the solutions found under PhysX_3.4\Source\compiler. 
Supported platforms: Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, iOS

(2) The APEX SDK distribution contains pre-built binaries supporting GPU acceleration.
Re-building the APEX SDK removes support for GPU acceleration. The solutions can be found under APEX_1.4\compiler. 
Supported platform: Windows, Linux, Android

To build PhysX Snippets: open one of the solutions found under \PhysX_3.4\Snippets\compiler.

To build PhysX Samples (windows only): open one of the solutions found under \PhysX_3.4\Samples\compiler.

To build APEX Snippets: open one of the solutions found under \APEX_1.4\snippets\compiler.

To build APEX Samples: open one of the solutions found under \APEX_1.4\samples_v2\compiler.
